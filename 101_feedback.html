    Feedback and Community 
  </h3> 

    <p>
    I found most helpful the ability to get feedback quickly (usually within just a few hours). I also appreciated being able to see others' submissions. This both helped me to figure out what I was doing wrong or missing when I felt stuck, and helped to reassure me that I was not the only person stuck on what seem to be very foundational problems.

  <h3> 
  Nuance 
  </h3>
    <p>
    I appreciated the technical nuance in many of the questions, particularly in the problem sets, because they made me realize that foundational does not mean simple.
    </p> 

  <h3> 
  Iteration 
  </h3>
    <p> I also appreciate the iterative nature of the projects and am finding that, even having taken almost 7 weeks off due to relocation and travel, that cadence of work and how to approach problems has stuck.

  <h3> 
    Stopping 
  </h3>
    <p>
    I wanted to dive in this summer because, having original found Launch School in the winter and then not feeling ready to dive in, I feel that I wasted several months when I could have been making progress instead. Having to take time off was not ideal, however I think the reflection time and realizing I did want to recommit and go all in will help make me more motivated as I establish new habits in a new location.

  <h3>
    Note-taking 
  </h3>
    <p>
    I have struggled to figure out a good way to note-take or capture information that I'm picking up from around the web. I might try to use Trello or something to make cards with solid resources I find, or even pieces of documentation I find myself coming back to again and again. For this reason, I wish the blog recommendation came closer to the beginning of 101, possibly even in the preparatory courses, as a way of pushing the learner to start recording their reflection and learnings in a written way.

    Part of me wants to say "we'll find out, won't we?"

<h3>
    Muscle-memory and Programmatic Thinking 
  </h3>
    <p>
    I'm not sure. Coming back I hopped right back into the bonuses for Twenty One, some of which I worked on during my hiatus. Getting back into it felt easy and natural, and the syntax now is also feeling quite straight forward. I was able to easily rewrite some methods, and even after a first-rewrite noticed how messy and redundant they were and further extracted to methods. The process felt very easy and natural, and I didn't have to look too many things up (I'd also been reading Poignant Why'd Ruby Guide in the time off).
    </p>

    <p>I don't think I would feel that way if I picked back up and had to hop straight back into Exercises without context.

  <h3>
    Exercises 
  </h3>

    <p>
    On which note - the exercises are hard. They are very tricky. Some, I will admit, I just read the answers for because I wasn't even entirely sure what was being asked. Some of this I imagine is that, this early in the program, the learner is still building the vocabulary for Ruby and coding and thinking programmatically.
    </p>

    <p> 
    Given the organization of the Launch School program, I have no doubt that I'll see these themes comes up again, and again, and again... and that they'll make more sense each time.

  <p>
   Um?

  <h3> 
    Program Flow 
  </h3>
    <p>
      Writing the overall program flow for Twenty One felt pretty straight forward, even when going back to logic through inserting some of the bonuses. Upon seeing the model version, I realized I had done a pretty hack and slash job, but I appreciated being given the openness to just -- create -- .
